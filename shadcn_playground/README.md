# shadCN testing grounds 

## to run

```bun run dev --open```
- starts up bun server 
- to close the server ``Ctrl-C``

- ```--open``` flag isn't necessary
    - will just attach running instance on default browser on port 5173 

- ```bun run db:push```
    - update DB schema  

## sources 
- since i mainly use svelte, i use a ported version of shadCN that works with SK 
- [shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs)
    - no "do or die" 
    - just had prior xp using bun+svelte so setup would be least painful
